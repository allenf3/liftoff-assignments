# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will help field service staff or managers to find the best route when heading out to do a small number of jobs. In addition, it will allow tracking of regularly visited locations and will use an API to ensure that a normalized version of the address is stored in the database.
### Features
[MVP]
1. User login and segregation of user data
2. CRUD actions for stored locations
3. Ability to select a number of stored locations to get the most efficient route

[Beyond MVP]
1. Save previously computed routes to avoid recalculation
2. Allow for rough (perhaps not the most efficient, but close) computation of larger sets of locations
3. Schedule jobs
4. Track resources required for jobs
### Technologies
1. C# 9
2. Blazor (Client-side)
3. ASP.Net Core 5
4. Bootstrap
5. (maybe) JavaScript
6. Melissa API
7. Bing Maps
8. ASP.Net Core Identity (for login)
9. CosmosDb (for persistence)
### What I'll Have to Learn
1. How to connect to the 2 APIs I will need to use (Melissa for address normalization and Bing Maps for routing data)
2. How to solve traveling salesman type problems
3. How to use NoSql data stores
4. How to use Blazor
5. Tree data structures?
